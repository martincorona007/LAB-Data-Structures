4th Class

hay un tipo de apuntador especial que ayuda a interpretar los cambios o conversion de tipo de dato
son apuntadores de tipo void.

POINTER ARITHMETIC

Assume a data type 't' which requires n bytes for storage if p is a pointer of type t, then n is the shifting unit of p

-suppose x is the address stored in the pointer p. then relative addresses to x can be calculated, measured in shifting
units, through the use of the sum (+) and difference (-) operators.

- the value itself of x can be increased or decreased in one shifting unit at time using the increase (++) and decrease(--)
operators respectively

REFERENCES

a reference is an alias (an alternative name) for an already existing variable.
either the variable name or the reference name may be used to refer to the variable. in the following example
b, is a reference of a:

example (ejemplo 2);

a reference must be initialized during its declaration.

struct indirection

let s be a struct and c an element of s. Suppose further a pointer p to struct s. the elements of struct s can be
accessed through indirection in the following way:

p -> c;

three different ways to access c:
° s.c
° p -> c
° (*p).c

DYNAMC MEMORY MANAGEMENT
an object can be created at runtime using the c++ operator new (or the standar fuction malloc in C)
this operation returns the reference(the address in memory) of the recently created object.

this new object can only be called indirectly (i.e. through indirection).

int *list = new int [10];

and object that is created in this way, must be eventually destroyed using the c++
operator deleted
