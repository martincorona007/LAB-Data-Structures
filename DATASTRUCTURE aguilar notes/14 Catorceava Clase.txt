DATA ELIMINATION

suppose you want to erase the data x. to do this, a search to x must be donde.
if the node is located, then it is erased from the list. Again, the search pointer
and the backup pointer(p and q) will be used.

a1 <= a2 <= ... <= an;

Assumen an ordered list. two cases may happen:

1- deletion occurs int the front of the list (x = a1)

Deletion by the middle/end
p != list;

Location criteria: p != null, p^.data = x;
 
Deletion algorithm

procedure supr(list: pointer to node, x: data)
precondition: the list is sorted
precondition: ¬empty(list)(ie. list != NULL)
p,q: pointers

1. p <- list
2. while p != NULL y p^.data < x do
3. q <- p
4. p <- p^.next
5. end while
6. if p != NULL y p^.data = x then{x was located}
7. if p = list then {deletion at the front}
8. list <- p^.next
9. else{deletion at the middle}
10. q^.next <- p^.next
11. end if
12. delete p
13. end if
