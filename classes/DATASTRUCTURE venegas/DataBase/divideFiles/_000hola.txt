policy adviser who pleaded guilty in the Russia investigation last year — was in more frequent contact with top campaign officials than has been reported.

again under question — this time after three witnesses Mueller has interviewed said he didn't push back against Papadopoulos' efforts to try to set up a 
meeting between Trump and R
