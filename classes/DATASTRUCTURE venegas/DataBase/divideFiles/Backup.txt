President Donald Trump's legal team experienced a shakeup this week. He considered hiring former US attorney and conservative media personality Joseph 
diGenova, and is said to be considering firing White House lawyer Ty Cobb.

John Dowd, Trump's personal defense attorney, resigned on Thursday because he was reportedly at odds with Trump over agreeing to an interview with 
special counsel Robert Mueller. That handed Mueller a huge win— Dowd was the biggest roadblock standing in the way of an interview between the president
 and special counsel.

Also this week, previously undisclosed emails described to The Washington Post indicated that George Papadopoulos — the former Trump campaign foreign 
policy adviser who pleaded guilty in the Russia investigation last year — was in more frequent contact with top campaign officials than has been reported.
Here's what else you may have missed this week in the Russia investigation:

    A key Russian hacker is unmasked: The Daily Beast reported that Guccifer 2.0, the suspected Russian-linked hacker who has taken credit for hacking
 into the Democratic National Committee and members of Hillary Clinton's campaign ahead of the 2016 US election, is directly tied to the GRU, Russia's 
military-intelligence outfit.
    Trump lawyers hand over documents: The president's legal team has given Mueller written materials about key events Mueller is scrutinizing as part
 of his investigation. The move comes as Mueller has been pushing for a face-to-face interview with Trump.
    Sessions' testimony comes under scrutiny: Attorney General Jeff Sessions' sworn Congressional testimony about his contacts with Russians is once 
again under question — this time after three witnesses Mueller has interviewed said he didn't push back against Papadopoulos' efforts to try to set up a 
meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Sessions has changed his account of the meeting several times now, but it remains unclear 
whether he will face any punishment for reportedly misleading Congress. 


Cambridge Analytica tested Trump slogans: The data analysis firm, which came under scrutiny last week after news broke that it harvested the data of 
50 million Facebook users without their permission, reportedly tested political slogans in 2014 that would later become hallmarks of Trump's 2016 campaign.
    Mueller looks into CA Several outlets reported Mueller's team has been investigating the Trump campaign's ties to Cambridge Analytica. 
It was also a bad week for the company's CEO, Alexander Nix, who was suspended after being caught on tape suggesting that he often took measures to 
bribe and entrap politicians.
    GOP releases Trump-Russia findings: Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday released a report detailing their conclusions in
 the panel's Russia investigation, although Democrats on the committee say parts of the report make several incomplete assertions that obscure facts.
    John Brennan makes a big claim: In an interview on MSNBC, former CIA director John Brennan said he believes Russia has compromising information 
on Trump that Moscow is using to blackmail him. "I think [Trump's] afraid of the President of Russia," Brennan continued. There is no public evidence 
supporting Brennan's claims.
    McCabe once investigated Sessions: ABC News reported Wednesday that former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe oversaw an investigation into Sessions
 for misleading lawmakers when asked about his contacts with Russians during his Senate confirmation hearing last year. McCabe was fired last week after
 the Department of Justice inspector general concluded in a report that McCabe was not forthcoming during the IG review. On Friday, McCabe bemoaned his 
firing in an op-ed in The Washington Post.

Stephanie Clifford, the porn actress known as Stormy Daniels, said she had sex with Donald Trump in 2006, recanting a statement denying the affair
 that Trump’s personal lawyer issued under her name in January.

Clifford said in an interview broadcast Sunday on CBS’s “60 Minutes” that she signed the denial, after the Wall Street Journal reported she’d been 
paid $130,000 to remain silent a month before the 2016 election, because she believed Trump’s lawyer, Michael Cohen, would make her “life hell in 
many different ways.”

She said she and her young daughter were physically threatened by an unidentified man in Las Vegas in 2011 if she revealed the affair. Earlier that
 year, Cohen threatened to sue In Touch magazine if it published an interview with Clifford in which she detailed the relationship, according to 
“60 Minutes.”

“I was concerned for my family and their safety,” she said.

Cohen and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday evening.

Clifford declined to answer questions about whether she had any text messages or videos documenting the relationship. Her attorney, Michael Avenatti,
 had hinted at the existence of such evidence in a provocative Twitter post last week.

Clifford, in her first television interview discussing the alleged affair, said she signed a non-disclosure agreement drawn up by Cohen in 2016 in
 part because she was afraid of potential physical harm, citing the 2011 threat.

“A guy walked up on me and said to me, ‘Leave Trump alone. Forget the story’,” she said, according to a transcript of the interview released by CBS.
 “And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, ‘That’s a beautiful little girl. It’d be a shame if something happened to her mom.’ 
And then he was gone.”

In Touch published its 2011 interview with Clifford in January, including details of the alleged affair with Trump, after the Wall Street Journal 
revealed the $130,000 payment. Trump has denied the affair through spokespeople. The White House has thus far declined to answer most questions 
about the alleged affair.

Cohen has said he paid Daniels out of his own pocket and wasn’t reimbursed by the Trump Organization, the president’s company, or by his campaign.
 He has not said whether the president personally reimbursed him.

Clifford sued in California state court to be released from the non-disclosure agreement, in part because she says Trump never signed it. Cohen 
and the president’s lawyers have threatened to claim as much as $20 million in damages from Clifford for violating the agreement and have sought
 to have the suit moved to federal court.

Clifford has offered to return the $130,000, and the advocacy group Common Cause has filed complaints with the Department of Justice and Federal
 Election Commission against Cohen and the president, claiming that the payment violated campaign finance law.

Clifford told interviewer Anderson Cooper that she met Trump in 2006 and agreed to have dinner in his hotel room, where the two later had sex.

In a separate interview with Cooper that aired last week on CNN, Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, said she had a 10-month affair with 
Trump that also began in 2006, the year Trump’s wife Melania gave birth to their son Barron. McDougal said she was in love with Trump but broke 
off the relationship after feeling guilty because he was married.
