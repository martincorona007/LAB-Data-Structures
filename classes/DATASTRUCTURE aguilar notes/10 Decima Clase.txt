QUEUES

a queue is a linear data structure where data insertion is madre on the one hand
and the extractions on the other.

capacity = n;
size = s;

the variable s indexes the next available box.
the value of s is also the size of the queue,
the queue is empty iff s = 0;
the queue is full s = n;

queue semantics

the fundamental queue operations are the following:

1. Enqueue(insertion): this operation consists in placing datum x at the end of the queue.
this is denoted enqueue (x)

2. dequeue(extraction): this operation is to remove a data from the front of the queue
this operation

3.

procedure enqueue(queue: array[n], x: data)
precondition: ¬full(queue)
queue[queue.s] <- x
inc(queue.s)

function dequeue(queue: array[n]): data
precondition: ¬empty(queue)
x: data
i: index
x <- queue [0]
i <- 0
dec(queue.s)
while i <= queue.s do
queue[i] <- queue[i + 1]
inc i
end while
return x;

fuction front (queue: array[n]): data
precondition: ¬empty(queue)
retur queue[0]
