Third class

-a pointer is a variable that stores the address of another variable
a pointer is used to indirectly access some variable, of which its tyoe and address are known
, but not its name. This operation is called the indirection of the varible

-the address that occupies a variable will be called its reference. 
The operation bye which a pointer acquires the reference of some variable is called the
referecing of the variable

apuntadores ejem.
"*p", "*q".

the reference operator (or address operator) & (ampersand) is used to take the address of some variable
.this value can be used to initialize a pointer

int *p = &a;  <--address of the int variable a !!!con esto pides la direccion de la variable "a"

INDIRECTION.
assume a pointer p which points to some variable a. using the direction operator * (asterisk) on p,
it is possible to access the data stored by a.

int a = 21;
int *p = &a;

printf ("%i\n", *p);

Resultados  p = (direccion);
	   *p = 21;

NULL POINTERS.
A null pointer is one that is assigned with null (NULL in C or nullptr in C++), rather than a memory address
This is a value reserved for indicating that the pointer does not points to a valid object and is equal to zero (0).

int *p = NULL;
if(p) printf("%i\n", *p);
else printf("None\n");
