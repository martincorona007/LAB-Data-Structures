ORDER
the problem of ordering

assume a set of phi such that for all alfa and beta members of phi
if alfa != beta then any alfa < beta or beta < alfa. that is to say that all the 
elements of phi are comparable to each other . let delta = a1a2...an
be a finite sequence of variables with domain phi

the ordering problem consists in reallocating the values of the variables a1, a2,...an
in such a way that ai <= ai + 1 is achieved for all 1 <= i < n, making delta an ordered
sequence:

a1 <= a2 <= ... <= an;

Bubble sorting

Assume the list lambda =  a1a2...an and consider the pair(ai,ai+1)
for all 1 <= i < n if ai > ai +1 we will make that ai and ai + 1 exchange their
values, in such a wat tgat ai <= ai + 1;

°since the list consists of n variables, there are n - 1 pairs of this form, namely
(a1, a2), (a2,a3),...,(an-1, an). we will apply this exchange to each one of these pairs
after the other in the same order as presented. at the end of this procedure the variable an
will contain the ggreatest value in the list.

°we repeat this procedure again for the pairs (a1, a2), (a2,a3),...,(an -2, an - 1).
after this, variable an - 1 will contain the second greatest value in the list.

°if we apply this procedure until the pair list is reduced to tonly pair(a1,a2), we will
have transformed lambda in an ordered list.

procedure bsort(lambda = a1a2...an)
i,j:indice
i- j <- 1
2- while j < n do
3-  i <- 0
4-   while 1 <= n - j do (restarle 1)
5-    if ai > ai +1 then swap(ai,ai +1)
6-    inc(i)
7-   end while
8-  inc(j)
9- end while
