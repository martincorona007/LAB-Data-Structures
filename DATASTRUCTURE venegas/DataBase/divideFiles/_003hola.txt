ttle girl. It’d be a shame if something happened to her mom.’ 
And then he was gone.”

In Touch published its 2011 interview with Clifford in January, including details of the alleged affair with Trump, after the Wall Street Journal 
revealed the $130,000 payment. Trump has denied the affair through spokespeople. The White House has thus far declined to answer most questions 
about the alleged affair.

Cohen has said he paid Daniels out of his own pocket and wasn’t reimbursed by the Trump Organization, the president’s company, or by his campaign.
 He has not said whether the president personally reimbursed him.

Clifford sued in California state court to be released from the non-disclosure agreement, in part because she says Trump never signed it. Cohen 
and the president’s lawyers have threatened to claim as much as $20 million in damages from Clifford for violating the agreement and have sought
 to have the suit moved to federal court.

Clifford has offered to return the $130,000, and the advocacy group Common Cause has filed complaints with the Department of Justice and Federal
 Election Commission against Cohen and the president, claiming that the payment violated campaign finance law.

Clifford told interviewer Anderson Cooper that she met Trump in 2006 and agreed to have dinner in his hotel room, where the two later had sex.

In a separate interview with Cooper that aired last week on CNN, Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, said she had a 10-month affair with 
Trump that also began in 2006, the year Trump’s wife Melania gave birth to their son Barron. McDougal said she was in love with Trump but broke 
off the relationship after feeling guilty because he was married.
